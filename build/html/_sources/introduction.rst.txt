Introduction
############

We developed Stone HMIS速 to oversee our network of medical centers, improve quality of care, and aid in health data collection and decision-making. It is an open-source health information and clinic management system with locally appropriate features that fit the realities of healthcare provision in Kenya. Core to Stone HMIS速 is its ability to operate across all types of care and platforms, bringing the benefits of health technologies to the whole health system. StoneHMIS速 is currently deployed in all 28 of our medical centers. In 2017, we will continue developing and evaluating the system and seek partnerships to scale Stone HMIS速 beyond the Ubuntu Afya network.
